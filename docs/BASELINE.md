# Current-version port baseline

Tracking: [baseline #3](https://github.com/Hashim-K/usagestat-bar/issues/3),
[GNOME #4](https://github.com/Hashim-K/usagestat-bar/issues/4),
[porting roadmap #2](https://github.com/Hashim-K/usagestat-bar/issues/2).

The reference is GNOME commit
[`9436c383`](https://github.com/Hashim-K/usagestat-bar/tree/9436c3834522745076c60937dc7c4c4a1649e6e8).
It includes changes newer than the remote `main` when the porting work began.
Use its implemented behavior and the checklist below, not just the older
README or the planned section of `FEATURES.md`.

The initial objective is to reproduce the current product on Linux desktops
and panels. Windows and macOS follow. Large shared-code refactoring and a
coordinated release pipeline belong to Phase 2; working, repeatable checks
belong to every Phase 1 port.

The [29 September roadmap review](ROADMAP.md) records the implemented Linux
baseline and the next release work. The reusable contract/fixture deliverable
is complete; target acceptance remains scoped to its evidence in #4–#13/#16.
The reference above is historical, not the current `main` revision.

## Feature contract

Each port must report every row as **passed**, **failed**, **untested**, or
**platform limitation** with an explanation and linked follow-up. A platform
limitation needs an explicit review before counting toward baseline completion.
Do not silently omit a current feature because a generic tray API lacks it.
Desktop-specific controls may use a documented native equivalent.

The five panel-edge checks for GNOME and Polybar are reviewed compatibility
skips, counted separately from passes and failures. They do not
block the supported baseline. Other untested scenarios and visual differences
still require their own evidence or review; see [result classification](TESTING.md#port-acceptance-report-template).

| ID | Required behavior | Reference implementation | Current automated coverage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CLI-1 | Discover the backend, respect an explicit executable path, and pass config/plugin/source options as separate arguments. | `cli.js`: `findAiUsage`, `fetchProviderUsage` | Contract tests |
| CLI-2 | Discover provider manifests; normalize metric and legacy usage payloads without losing valid windows or provider metadata. | `cli.js`: `fetchProviderManifests`, `normalizeBackendSnapshot` | Contract tests |
| CLI-3 | Report missing CLI, empty/malformed/failed responses; bound command execution, cancel a running command, and recover on the next refresh. | `cli.js`: `runAsync`, fetch functions; extension error rendering | Contract tests; native error/recovery check |
| CFG-1 | Preserve provider IDs/aliases, enabled state, order, distinct account/source instance IDs, custom names, and parent/child grouping. | `config.js`; `extension.js`: `_loadProviders`, `_childProviders` | Contract and native checks |
| CFG-2 | Persist config, custom commands, source/credential fields and provider settings privately; keep separate stable/dev config files. | `config.js`: `loadConfig`, `saveConfig` | Contract tests, including quoted commas and typed arrays |
| CFG-3 | Support adding/removing/reordering sources and providers, custom commands/icons, API tracking, hidden providers and per-source setup. | `prefs.js`: `ProvidersPage` | Real GTK add/remove/reorder, grouped API, custom commands/icons and hide/restore flows in two Xfce VMs |
| DATA-1 | Preserve quota units, periods, reset metadata and all standard/extra windows; clamp displayed percentages to 0–100. | `cli.js`; extension window rendering | Contract tests |
| DATA-2 | Explicit window selection uses the selected visible window; hidden selection falls back to automatic behavior. | `extension.js`: `_selectedPanelWindow` | Native checks |
| DATA-3 | Automatic panel usage is the mean of visible standard windows, with paid-usage fallback when primary quota is exhausted and the extra-usage window is available. | `extension.js`: `_automaticPanelWindow`, `_providerCostWindow` | Mean/visibility and exhausted-primary paid fallback in Linux model contracts |
| DATA-4 | Used/remaining modes change meter fill, text and logo fill consistently; thresholds still refer to **used** quota. | `extension.js`: `_displayPercent`, `_formatPercent`, `_panelProviderIcon` | Native checks and screenshots |
| DATA-5 | Display optional provider cost, today/yesterday/period cost summaries, badges/text, and pace information. Missing cost must not hide quota. | `cli.js`: `normalizeCostSummary`; extension cost/pace renderers | Enriched native fixture views cover cost/currency, credits, code review, pace/ETA and service status |
| VIEW-1 | Show a visible panel indicator, provider switcher, details, child sources, refresh/loading/error states and timestamps. | `extension.js`: `_render`, `_renderProvider`, `_renderChildProvider` | Native checks and screenshots; loading interaction still manual |
| VIEW-2 | Configure bar/percent/logo/text components and ordering, multiple providers, pinned providers, multiple usage bars, spacing and orientation. | GNOME settings schema; `_renderPanel`, `AppearancePage` | Native adapters cover pins/component order, provider count, supported edges and section geometry; optional tray and Polybar graphical limits remain explicit |
| VIEW-3 | Configure normal/threshold/neutral colors, provider icon styles, custom icons, and full/vertical/horizontal/pie logo fills. Preserve SVG presentation attributes. | `extension.js`: icon helpers; `prefs.js`: `AppearancePage` | SVG/raster and malformed/intrinsic-size custom SVG contracts, 155 Polybar glyph comparisons, light/dark preferences; full theme/fill combinations remain |
| VIEW-4 | Support panel placement/index, popup alignment, scroll switching, keyboard interaction and readable scaled/multi-monitor layouts. | GNOME panel/settings handlers | All 12 profiles have native input/section-alignment evidence; panel-edge compatibility skips are explicit. Older VM 1×/2× and Sway virtual-output checks do not cover full accessibility/physical displays |
| ALERT-1 | Choose the highest crossed custom threshold. First observation does not notify; repeated/downward readings do not notify; a later enabled upward crossing does. | `extension.js`: `_thresholdForUsedPercent`, `_maybeNotifyThreshold` | Actual native notification creation checked |
| PREF-1 | Open usable Behaviour, Appearance, Providers and Tools preferences, including per-provider edit entry points. | `prefs.js`; `_openProviderPreferences` | Four pages, provider entry points and representative widget flows on two distro/library generations |
| ACTION-1 | Expose the current status/dashboard links, reset formats, refresh controls, CLI/plugin setup and terminal/tool actions. | `extension.js`, `prefs.js` | Real URL handler and XTerm/backend launch in VMs; live installers/authentication and other terminals remain |
| LIFE-1 | Disable/re-enable cleanly, preserve settings, cancel pending work, and restore the indicator without duplicate instances. | Extension lifecycle; `cli.js` | In-flight upgrade, preferences-close cancellation, panel restart and reboot recovery in Xfce VMs |
| LIFE-2 | Clean install, upgrade preserving existing config, login/session restart, uninstall, and documented runtime dependencies. | Build/install scripts and target-specific packaging | Package checks plus Ubuntu 24.04/Fedora 44 Xfce login/upgrade/reboot/uninstall; other combinations remain |

## Shared fixture contract

[`tests/fixtures/scenarios.json`](../tests/fixtures/scenarios.json) records
the baseline revision, synthetic manifests, and named scenarios.
[`tests/fixtures/usagestat`](../tests/fixtures/usagestat) implements the
backend commands used by this app:

```text
usagestat --json [--config PATH] [--plugin-dir PATH] list
usagestat --json [--config PATH] [--plugin-dir PATH] usage --provider ID [--source SOURCE]
usagestat --json [--config PATH] [--plugin-dir PATH] cost --provider ID
```

These fixtures never call a provider or load real credentials. They include
normal/zero/75%/90%/full/over-limit usage, extra windows, missing optional
fields, legacy and array payloads, unavailable costs, empty/malformed/error
responses, and a hanging command. The config fixture has two visible providers
and an additional grouped account, without credentials.

Fetched/reset timestamps are deliberately fixed synthetic values. Cost dates
are generated for today and yesterday in the process timezone; automated runs
use UTC. These are behavioral fixtures, not pixel-perfect golden images.

Every future frontend should exercise these same scenarios, even if it uses
a different language/toolkit. The current GJS tests exercise the real GNOME
adapter. They are not a requirement to use GJS for other platforms.

## Defects fixed while capturing the baseline

- A timed-out CLI could leave a stale GLib timer ID and an unhelpful process
  status. Timeout now clears its source and returns an explicit error.
- Cancelling I/O did not terminate the directly launched CLI process. It now
  does; already-cancelled operations do not spawn a process. Custom shell
  commands that create their own process trees need separate coverage.
- Config always used `~/.config`, ignoring `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`. It now follows
  GLib's config-directory resolution, allowing disposable test settings.
- Config privacy depended on a later `chmod` subprocess. File replacement now
  requests private permissions when writing.
- Commas inside array strings split paths incorrectly and numeric/boolean
  array elements disappeared when loading. The parser now respects quoted
  commas, escapes and nested arrays, preserving the value types it writes.
- Installation copied the whole working directory, including development
  files, and could operate through a development symlink. It now installs
  the runtime-only release archive, replacing a symlink without touching its
  source. Build/install commands also work outside the checkout directory.

The config parser remains a limited TOML reader for the format this app writes;
it is not a general TOML implementation. Further parser or current-product
defects should be tracked and fixed explicitly, not adopted as desired port
behavior.

## Acceptance procedure

1. Record app commit (and dirty status), backend version, OS/distro, desktop,
   panel/compositor, session type, architecture and relevant dependencies.
2. Install in a clean target environment and run the contract fixtures.
3. Exercise the native indicator, detail/settings UI and notification path;
   retain logs, screenshots, commands and pass/fail results.
4. Check clean install, upgrade, restart/login and uninstall in a VM or real
   target session. Check keyboard access, themes, scaling and multiple displays.
5. Run a separate live-provider smoke check when an appropriate test account is
   available. Record the provider/version and outcome without uploading secrets
   or private usage data.
6. Attach a row-by-row parity report. A successful build, fixture check or one
   GNOME test session alone does not establish support for another desktop,
   distro, architecture or GNOME version.

See [testing instructions](TESTING.md) and the
[initial GNOME report](reports/gnome-50.4.md). The
[September 7 acceptance report](reports/linux-acceptance.md) retains VM lifecycle,
preferences and live-provider evidence. Use the
[September 27 fix report](reports/linux-port-fixes-2026-09-27.md) for the latest
